# Composing Templates

One of the primary reasons that Cyto templates are so powerful is that they are composable, meaning that templates can have other templates as dependencies. This allows you to make templates that are much more modular and reusable. For those who are familiar with React, this design choice was heavily inspired by how React components work.

To indicate that a template depends on another template, we use object dependencies. Let's take a look at the `cyto/composing` template, which depends on the `cyto/composed` template:

`/<pathToGTL>/cyto/composing/cyto.config.js`
```js
module.exports = {
  templateId: "cyto/composing",
  dependencies: [
    'composing.txt',
    {
      templateId: 'cyto/composed',
      args: {
        id: 'composedTemplate',
        templateArg: 'I was passed via another template'
      }
    },
  ],
  args: [
    { id: 'userArg' },
  ],
  options: {
    createDirectory: false,
  }
};
```
`/<pathToGTL>/cyto/composing/composing.txt`
```
This template was given a userArg value of: {{userArg}}
```
`/<pathToGTL>/cyto/composed/cyto.config.js`
```js
module.exports = {
  templateId: "cyto/composed",
  dependencies: [
    'composed.txt',
  ],
  args: [
    { id: 'templateArg' },
    { id: 'userArg' }
  ],
  options: {
    createDirectory: false,
  }
};
```
`/<pathToGTL>/cyto/composed/composed.txt`
```
cyto/composed was generated by another template and given an id of: {{id}}

This template was given a userArg value of: {{userArg}}

The parent template supplied this value: {{templateArg}}
```

Object dependencies must have 2 keys: `templateId`, which specifies the template we need to generate, and `args`, which is an object that maps args to values. Cyto will not prompt the user for any arguments supplied this way. Since the `id` arg is required for all templates, it must be supplied by the parent template. This is what the generation of `cyto/composing` will look like:

```bash
> cyto gen cyto/composing compose
Generating cyto/composing with id compose
? userArg:  foo
Generating cyto/composed with id composedTemplate
? userArg:  bar
> cat composing.txt
This template was given a userArg value of: foo
> cat composed.txt
cyto/composed was generated by another template and given an id of: composedTemplate

This template was given a userArg value of: bar

The parent template supplied this value: I was passed via another template
```

Note that although both templates have an arg called `userArg`, they both get prompted for it. Cyto generates each template independently, so one set of args doesn't clobber another.
