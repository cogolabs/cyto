Case 1: This template is passed the same context as cyto/partialsDemo
{{> cyto/tutorial }}

Case 2: These templates are passed the context from the `thingsToGreet` arg
{{# thingsToGreet }}
{{> cyto/tutorial}}
{{/ thingsToGreet }}

Case 3: You can also explicitly specify the id of a partial by adding another
string to the partial tag
{{> cyto/tutorial baz }}

on the value of another argument
{{> {{partialToGenerate}} qux }}
