A declarative boilerplate generator designed to help you write less meaningless code and think more deeply about your project structure.

<Put a screen capture of some cool usage here>

## Installation

Cyto is primarily meant to be used as a global command line tool:
```bash
> yarn global install cyto
# or `npm install -g cyto`
> cyto init
```

It can also be used as a library in any node.js application (more on this later)

## Getting Started
Cyto is a boilerplate generator. If you're unfamiliar with what that is, boilerplate code is code that is repeated in many places with little to no alteration. A boilerplate generator is a tool that can generate that code for you automatically, prompting you for any neccesary information along the way. Whenever the documentation mentions "generation", this is what it is referring to.

The core concept of Cyto is the generation of templates. Templates can be thought of as blueprints: they tell Cyto what to generate, what arguments to prompt the user for, and any special options to use. They are stored in a global template library (abbreviated as GTL), which is just a directory that you set when you run `cyto init`. Let's see what a simple cyto template that generates a single file with some custom text looks like:

1. `/<path to GTL>/cyto/hello/cyto.config.js`
```js
module.exports = {
  templateId: "cyto/hello",
  dependencies: [
    '{{id}}.txt',
  ],
  args: [
    {
      id: 'thingToGreet',
      default: 'world',
    },
  ],
  options: {
    createDirectory: false,
  }
};
```
2. `/<path to GTL>/cyto/hello/{{id}}.txt`
```
Hello {{thingToGreet}}!

This file was generated by {{author}} using Cyto.
```

Even at it's simplest, there's a decent amount of information to process here, so let's break it down a bit starting with the `cyto.config.js` file. This file is the key piece of a Cyto template. It holds all of the relevant information about a template; all other files will only ever contain boilerplate to generate. As you can see above, all that it does is export a Javascript object with 4 keys: 

1. `templateId`: A unique identifier for the template. This will determine where Cyto looks for the template in the GTL.
2. `dependencies`: An array that represents everything a template needs to be generated. Each dependency can be a string, an object, or a function (more on these later). In this template, we have one string dependency: `{{id}}.js`. This means Cyto will look for a file called `{{id}}.js` inside of the `cyto/hello` directory and output it when the template is generated. 
3. `args`: An array of objects that represents all of the values that Cyto needs to get from a user in order to properly generate the template. Arguments can have a few different types (more on this later as well), but the default type is a string. The `cyto/hello` template only requires 1 argument, `thingToGreet`, which has a default value of `world`
4. `options`: An object that holds a collection of values to set while running cyto. Here, we set the `createDirectory` flag to false, which tells cyto not to create a new directory to hold all of the template's generated content (note: this is the default, it's just included for illustrative purposes)

The `{{id}}.txt` file, as mentioned above, is a dependency for the template and contains some boilerplate to generate. However, before this file is actually generated, it is passed through a slightly modified version (assume everything is the same unless otherwise mentioned) of [mustache](https://mustache.github.io/mustache.5.html) to take the supplied arguments and insert them into the boilerplate. If you're unfamiliar with mustache, stop here and take a few minutes to familiarize yourself with the syntax.

Before we move on to actually generating this template, there are a few things to mention about this template. For every string dependency, the filename is also passed through the mustache renderer, so if the `id` argument is set to `hello`, the name of the generated file will be `hello.txt`. Additionally, all templates must be given a unique `id` arg at generation time so it isn't specified in the `args` section of the `cyto.config.js` file and the `author` arg is provided by default by Cyto.

Now that we understand what a Cyto template's basic structure is, let's generate it! The command to generate a template is `cyto gen <templateId> <id>`, so generating the template above will look like this:

```
> cyto gen cyto/hello hello
Generating cyto/hello with id hello
? thingToGreet:  new Cyto user
> cat hello.txt
Hello new Cyto user!

And that's it! You've just generated your first boilerplate with Cyto. Hopefully you can see the utility of a tool like Cyto. However, there's still a decent amount of other features to cover that make Cyto even more powerful.
