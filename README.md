A declarative boilerplate generator designed to help you write less meaningless code.

<Put a screen capture of some cool usage here>

## Installation

Cyto is primarily meant to be used as a global command line tool:

```bash
> yarn global add cyto
# or `npm install -g cyto`
> cyto init
```

It can also be used as a library in any node.js application (more on this later)

## What is Cyto
Cyto is a boilerplate generator. If you're unfamiliar with what that is, boilerplate code means code repeated in many places with little to no alteration. A boilerplate generator is a tool that can generate that code for you automatically, prompting you for any necessary information along the way.

The main problem Cyto aims to solve is how to generate the _correct_ amount of boilerplate while being flexible and easy to use. Many existing boilerplate projects lock you into another developer's preferences while giving you more than you need or not enough. Modifying them to fit your use case can, in some cases, be more work that starting from scratch. By providing a simple and consistent interface, Cyto provides a new and improved solution to the age-old problem of boilerplate generation.

## Getting Started
The core concept of Cyto is the generation of templates. Templates are user-created blueprints for boilerplate: they tell Cyto what to generate, what arguments to prompt the user for, and any special options to use. Each template is just a directory that contains a `cyto.config.js` file and any number of boilerplate files. They are stored in the global template library (abbreviated as GTL), which is just a directory that you set when you run `cyto init`. The GTL also includes some examples to help you get started. Let's look at the `cyto/tutorial` template, which generates a single text file:

1. `/<path to GTL>/cyto/tutorial/cyto.config.js`
```js
module.exports = {
  templateId: "cyto/tutorial",
  dependencies: [
    '{{id}}.txt',
  ],
  args: [
    {
      id: 'thingToGreet',
      default: 'world',
    },
  ],
  options: {
    createDirectory: false,
  }
};
```
2. `/<path to GTL>/cyto/tutorial/{{id}}.txt`
```
Hello {{thingToGreet}}!

This file was generated by {{author}} using Cyto.
```

Even at it's simplest, there's a decent amount of information to process here, so let's break it down a bit starting with the `cyto.config.js` file. This file is the key piece of a Cyto template. It holds all of the relevant information about a template; all other files will only ever contain boilerplate to generate. Although the config file must be written in Javascript, the boilerplate that Cyto can generate is language independent. Each config must export an object with four keys:

1. `templateId`: A unique identifier for the template. This will determine where Cyto looks for the template in the GTL. Each `templateId` must be of the format `<group>/<name>`, where `group` is a logical grouping for related templates and `name` is a more specific descriptor for that template within the group. This template is in the `cyto` group and has a name of `tutorial`.
2. `dependencies`: An array that represents everything a template needs to be generated. Each dependency can be a string, an object, or a function (more on these later). In this template, we have one string dependency: `{{id}}.js`. This means Cyto will look for a file called `{{id}}.js` inside of the `cyto/hello` directory and output it when the template is generated.
3. `args`: An array of objects that represents all of the values that Cyto needs to get from a user in order to properly generate the template. Arguments can have a few different types (more on this later as well), but the default type is a string. The `cyto/hello` template only requires 1 argument, `thingToGreet`, which has a default value of `world`
4. `options`: An object that holds a collection of values to set while running cyto. Here, we set the `createDirectory` flag to false, which tells cyto not to create a new directory to hold all of the template's generated content (note: this is the default, it's just included for illustrative purposes)

The `{{id}}.txt` file, as mentioned above, is a dependency for the template and contains some boilerplate to generate. However, before this file is actually generated, it is passed through a [mustache](https://mustache.github.io/mustache.5.html) renderer to take the supplied arguments and insert them into the boilerplate. If you're unfamiliar with mustache, stop here and take a few minutes to familiarize yourself with the syntax.

There are a couple other things to mention about this template. For every string dependency, the filename is also passed through the mustache renderer. In this example, if the `id` argument is set to `hello`, the name of the generated `{{id}}.js` file will be `hello.txt`. All templates must be given a unique `id` arg at generation time, so you don't need to specify that in the args section of the `cyto.config.js` file. Cyto also provides the `author` variable by default.

Now that we understand what a Cyto template's basic structure is, let's generate it! The command to generate a template is `cyto gen <templateId> <id>`, so generating the template above will look like this:

```
> cyto gen cyto/hello hello
Generating cyto/hello with id hello
? thingToGreet:  new Cyto user
> cat hello.txt
Hello new Cyto user!

This file was generated by Connor Taylor using Cyto.
```

And that's it! You've just generated your first boilerplate with Cyto. However, this is fairly trivial example. Cyto really starts to shine when you make use of its more advanced features, which will be explained in the rest of the documentation.

## Template Arguments

The `cyto/tutorial` template is great for explaining the core mechanics of Cyto, but we glossed over some important details. In this section, we're going to dive into more detail about the `args` section of a Cyto template, using the `cyto/argumentDemo` template to help demonstrate the different types of arguments. Lets take a look at an argument with all of the possible keys you can use:

```js
{
  id: 'demoArg',
  type: 'list', // default: string
  default: [] // default: undefined
  dontPrompt: false, // default: false
}
```

1. `id`: A unique identifier for an argument within a given template.
2. `type`: A string identifier for what type an argument is. Cyto supports four different types of arguments: `string` (default), `list`, `boolean`, and `function`.
3. `default`: A default value for the argument. Pretty self explanatory.
4. `dontPrompt`: A boolean flag that indicates if Cyto should avoid prompting the user for a value for this argument and use its default.

That's all there is to arguments! However, there are a couple caveats regarding `function` arguments. Let's take a look at the `functionArg` from the `cyto/argumentDemo` template:

```js
{
  id: 'functionArg',
  type: 'function',
  default: () => {
    return (text, render) => {
      return render(text)
        .then((renderedText) => {
          return renderedText.replace('Replace me', 'Got replaced');
        });
    }
  },
  dontPrompt: true
}
```

Currently, Cyto is unable to prompt the user for functions via the command line, so they must be provided via `default` and have `dontPrompt` set to `true`. Function arguments also look a bit different than how they are detailed in the mustache documentation. This is because Cyto uses a slightly modified version of [mustache.js](https://github.com/janl/mustache.js/) where the rendering process is asynchronous. This means that the `render` function returns a [Promise](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise) that resolves with the rendered text, instead of returning the rendered text immediately. The reason behind this is due to how Cyto handles mustache partials, which will be explained in a later section.

## Creating Your Own Templates

The final thing to cover before moving on to more complex concepts is how to create your own templates. Creating your own Cyto templates is just as important as generating them and is done via the `cyto create <templateId>` command:

```
> cyto create taylorc93/myFirstTemplate
? files: someDependencyFile.js
> ls /path/to/GTL/taylorc93/myFirstTemplate
cyto.config.js        someDependencyFile.js
```

Under the hood, this command is just generating the `cyto/template` template and is (almost) functionally equivalent to calling `cyto gen cyto/template <yourTemplateName>`. This template accepts one list argument: `files`, which will create the boilerplate files the new template needs. `cyto create` will automatically place the template in the GTL for you. That's all there is to it!

## Composing Templates

One of the primary reasons that Cyto templates are so powerful is that they are composable, meaning that templates can have other templates as dependencies. This allows you to make templates that are much more modular and reusable. For those who are familiar with React, this design choice was heavily inspired by how React components work.

To indicate that a template depends on another template to be generated, we use object dependencies. Let's take a look at what the `cyto.config.js` file for the `cyto/composing` template, which depends on the `cyto/composed` template:

```js
[
  'composing.txt',
  {
    templateId: 'cyto/composed',
    args: {
      id: 'composedTemplate'
      templateArg: 'I was passed via another template'
    }
  }
]
```

Object dependencies must have 2 keys: `templateId`, which specifies the template we need to render, and `args`, which is a list of args to supply to the template. This way, we can avoid having to prompt the user for arguments if possible. Since the `id` arg is required for all templates before the user is prompted for arguments, it must be supplied by the parent template.
